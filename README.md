I went threw the HTML and CSS side by side and renamed certain classes as to eleminate excess code. Items in sections that shared identical CSS values were combined.
I noticed the missing ID for the first portion on the nav bar so I added that in.
I also removed the excess use of Div's as well as changed the main body to articles. I read in module 1 that screen readers have a better time reading articles because it groups the related text into one portion to then pass onto the user.
